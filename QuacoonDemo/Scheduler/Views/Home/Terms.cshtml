Such cite may not include a Quacoon logo without Quacoon’s prior written approval or imply any relationship between you and Quacoon beyond Quacoon being a source of the Aggregate Data.

7. Fees.

A. Generally. You may be required to pay fees to access certain features of the Services. All fees are in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable. If Quacoon changes the fees for all or part of the Services, including by adding fees or charges, Quacoon will provide you advance notice of those changes. If you do not accept the changes, Quacoon may discontinue providing the applicable part of the Services to you. Quacoon’s authorized third-party payment processor will charge the payment method you specified at the time of purchase. You authorize Quacoon to charge all fees as described in these Terms of Use for the Services you select to that payment method. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Quacoon may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account before your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.

B. Subscriptions. The Services may include features that allow for automatically recurring payments for periodic charges ("Subscription Service"). If you decide to activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Quacoon to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription, or we terminate it. You must cancel your Subscription Service before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fee to your account. We will bill the periodic subscription fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). Quacoon may change the subscription fee for any subsequent subscription period but will provide you advance notice of any increase before it applies. Unless otherwise stated in your product-specific agreement, you may cancel a Subscription Service by contacting us at: tasebast@gmail.com, by contacting your business consultant, or through your settings page for the paid feature.

8. User Materials.

A. UGC Definition; License Grant. Certain portions of the Services may allow users to upload or otherwise provide to Quacoon images, photos, video, data, text, listings, and other content (“User Materials”).

Quacoon will not pay you for your User Materials or to exercise any rights related to your User Materials set forth in the preceding sentence. Quacoon may remove or modify your User Materials at any time. You are solely responsible for all User Materials made through your user account(s) on the Services or that you otherwise make available through the Services. For all User Materials, you represent and warrant that you are the creator and owner of the User Materials, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions (including all permissions required under applicable privacy and intellectual property law) to authorize Quacoon and other users to access and use your User Materials as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you under these Terms of Use. Quacoon will not use client contact information that is uploaded by agents into the Quacoon Hub portal for any purpose.

B. UGC Disclaimer. Quacoon is under no obligation to edit or control your User Materials or the User Materials of any other User and will not be in any way responsible or liable for any User Materials. Quacoon may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Materials on the Services, including User Materials, that in Quacoon’s sole judgment violate these Terms of Use or are otherwise objectionable, including in any way described in our Good Neighbor Policy described in Section 14(B). You understand that when using the Services, you may be exposed to User Materials of other users and acknowledge that User Materials may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable.

Third-Party Providers are solely responsible for their services. You are responsible for your use and submission of User Information to any third-party, and your dealings or business conducted with any third party arising in connection with the Services are solely between you and such third party. Your use of third-party sites, services, or products may be subject to associated third-party terms of use and privacy policies or other agreements, which you are solely responsible for complying with.

If you include your name, contact information and other information in a request, your identity will no longer be anonymous to the Third-Party Provider. Your submission of information and any request for quotes through the Services is not an application for credit. Quacoon is only providing an administrative service to consumers and participating Lenders. Decisions regarding Lenders contacting consumers are made by participating Lenders and not Quacoon. By using these features, the disclosures and consent required under certain state laws are deemed to be provided, received, and agreed to. Interest rates displayed through the Services are for information purposes only and reflect non-binding customized quotes of the terms a Lender might offer a borrower fitting a consumer’s anonymous profile. Actual interest rates may vary. Loan approval standards are established and maintained solely by individual Lenders. Consumers should rely on their own judgment in deciding which available loan product, terms, and Third-Party Provider best suit their needs and financial means.
